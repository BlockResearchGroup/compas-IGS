# Introduction

## Graphic statics

Graphic statics is widely known as a design and analysis method for two-dimensional (2D) discrete structures, that relies on geometrical rather than analytical or numerical representations of the relation between a structure’s geometry and the equilibrium of its internal forces. Graphical representation of equilibrium using reciprocal form and force diagrams provides invaluable insight for designers and improves intuitive understanding of a structure’s behaviour through a visual medium that is easier to understand and more transparent than conventional, arithmetic or numerical methods.

A form diagram describes the geometrical configuration of the (axial) internal and external forces of a two-dimensional structural system, and a force diagram represents their equilibrium. The combination of these two diagrams allows for an intuitive evaluation of structural behaviour, performance and efficiency at a glance.

## Computational graphic statics

Graphic statics gradually disappeared from structural engineering practice over the 20th century due to the advancement of computers and powerful numerical software. However, there has been a recent revival of graphic statics through computational implementations, which have enabled dynamic interaction between form and force diagrams with real-time, visual feedback. These interactive implementations of graphic statics allow users to directly control the geometry of forces, which enable force-driven design approaches with high formal freedom to create structurally informed geometries during early stages of design.
