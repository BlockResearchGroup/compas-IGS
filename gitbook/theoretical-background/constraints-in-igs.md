# Constraints in IGS

The following drawing summarises the possible constraints in IGS.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (98).png>)

1. **Anchor a vertex**, fixing its x, y coordinates;
2. Constraint a vertex to a **line of action**;
3. Constraint **edge direction**; and
4. Apply **target forces** in the form diagram which reflect in target lengths in the force diagram.

These constraints are applied in the examples below. Specially on the [funicular arch](../examples/2..md) and on the [constant force truss](../examples/wip-gable-truss.md).
