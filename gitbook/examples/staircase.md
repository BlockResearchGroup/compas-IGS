# Staircase

The stair below is composed of 33 curves. It requires 5 independent edges, that are selected as forces applied to the top girder of the stair (assigned with negative sign). The form and force diagram obtained with IGS are shown below:

We could envisage a slope change of the structure, to be executed in the force diagram. We first fix the four central portions of the structure to serve as a reference. Then we define the new slope and calculate the deflection that any couple of nodes in the force diagram has to overcome. The scheme with the magnitude of these displacements is shown in the next figure:

After this modification, the equilibrium is recomputed and the shape of the stair with the new slope is found:
