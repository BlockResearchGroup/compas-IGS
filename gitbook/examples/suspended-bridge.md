# Suspended Bridge

The asymmetrical suspended bridge below was calculated with IGS. It is composed of 29 edges. It requires 7 independent edges, that we select as the loads applied to the deck to the right of the pylon. The height of the pylon is 5.0m above and beyond the deck.

We could be interested in reducing the magnitude of the forces in the deck, this can be achieved with a higher pylon. Moving the top of the pylon is a good idea, a sin the picture below:

The final form and force diagram are depicted below:

The suspended bridge is a great example to test also the unified diagram. This diagram contains at the same time the form and the force diagram and can be modified through the parameter alpha which scales it to meet the form or the force diagram. The Force diagram can be rotated of 90 degrees to enhance the visualisation. The results are depicted below:
