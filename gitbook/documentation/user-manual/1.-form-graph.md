# 1. form graph

The input form diagram representing the structure should be a **planar graph** with leaf edges representing the boundary conditions (loads and supports).

This user manual gives a more detailed explanation of the [tutorial](../../quick-start/tutorial.md) developed to the single panel truss example represented in the image below:

## The input sketch

The structural problem above should be translated to **straight segments** in Rhino. The following shows the "sketch" that is necessary to create the form diagram.

As mentioned above, edges should be added to represent loads and boundary conditions.

Once this set of lines is inserted in IGS the leaf edges are lighlighted in green and internal edges are black.

A few rules should be observed to create this form graph. The graph should not contain overlaps, and it should not containt 2-valent nodes, as in the figure below:

## Directed form graph

Inside IGS, this graph is interpreted as a directed graph described by the matrix **C** defined below:
