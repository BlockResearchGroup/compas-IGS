# 4. solve equilibrium matrix

## Equilibrium through independent edges

The equations of equilibrium can be rearanged such that the equilibrium matrix **A** is defined as explained in the following chart:

Where **q** represent the force densities in the edges of the form diagram. With the  definition of the equilibrium matrix the matrix A can be sliced and the forces in the dependent edges are calculated based on the forces assigned to the independent ones.

With such operations the new coordinates of the force diagram **x\***, **y\*** are computed. The update in the force graph is explained in the following section.
