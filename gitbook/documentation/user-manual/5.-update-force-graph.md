# 5. update force graph

The new coordinates of the force diagram computed through the [previous step](5.-update-force-graph.md) are then assigned to the repective nodes of the dual force graph [created in step ](2.-force-graph.md)2. As a result, the topology created is modified and both diagrams are [reciprocal](6..md).
