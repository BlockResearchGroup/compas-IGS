# 2. force graph

The form graph has a dual graph associated to it. This dual graph is defined below, and after the equilibrium is computed this dual graph transforms in the force diagram of the problem.

## Dual graph

The dual graph of the single panel truss is depicted below. It is created by following the spaces of the form diagram.&#x20;

This topology is also described by a connectivity matrix **C\*** defined below:

## Dual relationships

The following immage shows the form and the dual diagrams side by side. Both diagrams have the same **number of edges.**

The **faces** of the **force diagram** are related to **internal vertices** in the **form diagram**

With such relations, the equilibrium of each node of the form diagram is related to a **closed polygon in the force diagram**. The following images show these relation for the internal nodes of the form diagram:

## Diagram orientation

As obeserved above, the dual diagram will generate edges that are perpendicular to the original edge sin the form diagram. However, up to a rotation of 90Ëš this relationship can be changed, and how instead of perpendicular the edges in equilibrium will be parallel.
