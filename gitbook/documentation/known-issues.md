# Known Issues

## I can not initiate IGS

If you face problems to initiate IGS and receives the following message:

`Unknown command: 'IGS__init'`

Please try running the command `EditPythonScript` as this command activates the Python environment in Rhino.

Then close the pop-up window and try to initialise the plug-in again.

## My form/force diagram disappear

This is usually related to the fact that you initiated IGS in a different window or even that you initiated IGS before opening the file with the lines to work on.

Please close Rhino and start it again by initialising the plug-in.
